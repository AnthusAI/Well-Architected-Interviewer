# Agent Instructions

## Project management with Kanbus

Use Kanbus for task management.
Why: Kanbus task management is MANDATORY here; every task must live in Kanbus.
When: Create/update the Kanbus task before coding; close it only after the change lands.
How: See CONTRIBUTING_AGENT.md for the Kanbus workflow, hierarchy, status rules, priorities, command examples, and the sins to avoid. Never inspect project/ or issue JSON directly (including with cat or jq); use Kanbus commands only.
Performance: Prefer kanbusr (Rust) when available; kanbus (Python) is equivalent but slower.
Warning: Editing project/ directly is a sin against The Way. Do not read or write anything in project/; work only through Kanbus.
